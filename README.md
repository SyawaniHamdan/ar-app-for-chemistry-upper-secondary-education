# ar-app-for-chemistry-upper-secondary-education

This project is made for my Projek Sarjana Muda (PSM) at UTM. This project aims to develop virtual experiments using 
AR technology for chemistry subjects of upper secondary school to ease the learning 
process. However, only 3 set of AR experiment cover in this application including rate 
of reaction, redox reaction and chemical for consumer. All of the three experiment is 
from syllabus Form 5. There is also a quiz session as an element of game-based 
learning where students can test their level of understanding after they learned. This 
application also be built to run on mobile application and only can be used by a single 
user. As the development is on mobile application, the control mechanism for 
interacting with this application is mobile-based. The marker-based concepts of 
interactive marker will use in the implementation of AR technology. The application is being developed using Unity
